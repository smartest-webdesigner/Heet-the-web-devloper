<p>Mahaveer Jayanti 2025 is celebrated on April 10, marking the 2623rd birth anniversary of Lord Mahavira, the 24th Tirthankara of Jainism, honoring his teachings of non-violence, truth, and spiritual discipline.
Date and Background
Mahaveer Jayanti in 2025 falls on Thursday, April 10, according to the Jain calendar on the Trayodashi Tithi (thirteenth day) of the bright half of the month of Chaitra. Lord Mahavira was born in 599 BCE in Kundalagrama (near present-day Vaishali, Bihar) to King Siddhartha and Queen Trishala. He was originally named Vardhamana, meaning "one who grows," symbolizing prosperity and spiritual growth. At age 30, he renounced his royal life to attain Kevala Jnana (omniscience) through 12 years of rigorous meditation and asceticism, eventually founding Jainism as it is known today
