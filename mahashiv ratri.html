<p>Mahashivratri is a major Hindu festival dedicated to Lord Shiva, celebrated with fasting, night-long vigil, prayers, and rituals that honor Shiva’s cosmic roles of creation, preservation, and destruction, and symbolize the triumph of light over darkness and ignorance.
When is Mahashivratri?
Mahashivratri is observed annually on the 14th night of the waning moon (Krishna Paksha Chaturdashi) in the Hindu month of Phalguna, which falls between February and March in the Gregorian calendar. In 2025, Mahashivratri will be celebrated on February 26th, with festivities often spanning the preceding night and early hours of the next day.
Significance and Legends
Cosmic Dance of Shiva (Tandava): It is believed Shiva performs the divine cosmic dance symbolizing creation, preservation, and destruction, maintaining the universal cycle. This sacred dance is a key reason for the festival’s spiritual importance.
Marriage of Shiva and Parvati: Mahashivratri commemorates the sacred wedding of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati, representing the harmonious union of masculine and feminine cosmic energies.
Shiva’s Sacrifice during Samudra Manthan: According to legend, Shiva saved the universe by drinking the deadly poison (Halahala) that emerged from the cosmic ocean’s churning, which turned his throat blue, earning him the name Neelkanth.
Infinite Jyotirlinga: The festival also celebrates the appearance of Shiva as the infinite pillar of light (Jyotirlinga), symbolizing his boundless cosmic form beyond human comprehension.
How is Mahashivratri Celebrated?
Fasting: Devotees observe a strict fast, with some undertaking nirjala vrat (without water), as a form of self-purification and devotion.
Night Vigil (Jagaran): The night is spent awake in prayer, chanting Shiva mantras like "Om Namah Shivaya" and the Maha Mrityunjaya mantra, singing devotional hymns, and meditating to connect deeply with Shiva’s energy.
Shiva Lingam Worship: Shiva Lingams in temples are bathed (Abhishekam) with sacred items such as milk, honey, yogurt, ghee, water, and bel (Bilva) leaves—items believed to please Lord Shiva. Devotees often visit prominent Shiva temples like Mahakaleshwar in Ujjain, Kashi Vishwanath in Varanasi, and Shiva shrines in Maharashtra and Karnataka.
Offering of Bel Leaves and Sacred Items: Bel leaves hold special importance as they cool Shiva’s body and symbolize devotion. Fruits, incense, flowers, and sweets are also offered during pujas.
Meditation and Spiritual Reflection: Mahashivratri is also a time for introspection, self-realization, and spiritual growth, with many devotees practicing deep meditation or yoga.
Cultural and Regional Practices: In Maharashtra, grand temple celebrations and fairs are common, and devotees often stay up throughout the night performing rituals. Some regions stage processions and reenact the marriage of Shiva and Parvati.
Spiritual and Cosmic Importance
Mahashivratri represents overcoming darkness and ignorance through the light of consciousness. It is regarded as a night that cleanses past karma and inspires spiritual awakening. Yogic traditions teach that planetary alignments during this time enhance spiritual energy, making it an ideal night to awaken inner potential and channel divine blessings.
