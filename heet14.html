Ancient Indian epic
The Ramayana is an ancient Indian epic attributed to the sage Valmiki, composed around the 5th century BCE. It narrates the life and adventures of Lord Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu, focusing on his quest to rescue his wife, Sita, from the demon king Ravana. The epic is divided into seven books and consists of approximately 24,000 verses, featuring a rich tapestry of characters, including humans, celestial beings, and demons. The Ramayana is not only a story of heroism and devotion but also imparts moral lessons and cultural values, making it a revered text in Hinduism and influential across South and Southeast Asia.
