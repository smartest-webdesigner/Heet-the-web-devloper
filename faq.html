<p>1. How old is the Earth?
Earth is approximately 4.5 billion years old, based on radiometric dating of rocks and meteorites.
2. What is Earth’s position and size in the solar system?
Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet by size. It orbits about 93 million miles (1 astronomical unit) from the Sun, completing one orbit in about 365.25 days.
3. What is Earth made of?
Earth consists of four main layers:
Crust: Thin, solid outer layer (about 30 km thick average).
Mantle: Thick layer of hot, semi-solid rock (about 2,900 km thick).
Outer core: Liquid layer made mainly of iron and nickel.
Inner core: Solid iron and nickel sphere at the center, extremely hot (up to 5,400°C).
4. What is Earth’s atmosphere composed of?
The atmosphere is mainly 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, plus small amounts of argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases. This composition is vital for sustaining life and protects the surface from harmful solar radiation and space debris.
5. How much of Earth's surface is covered by water?
About 71% of Earth's surface is covered by water, mostly oceans. This water exists in liquid, solid (ice), and gas (vapor) forms, making Earth unique among known planets.
6. Does Earth have moons or rings?
Earth has one natural moon, called the Moon, which stabilizes Earth's axial tilt and causes tides. Earth has no rings, unlike some other planets.
7. How fast does Earth rotate and orbit?
Earth rotates on its axis roughly every 23 hours and 56 minutes, spinning from west to east, causing day and night. It orbits the Sun at an average speed of about 67,000 miles per hour (107,000 km/h).
8. What causes Earth's seasons?
Earth’s axis is tilted about 23.4 degrees relative to its orbit around the Sun. This tilt leads to varying sunlight distribution throughout the year, causing the seasons.
9. How did Earth form?
Earth formed from the solar nebula about 4.5 billion years ago through gravitational accretion of gas, dust, and rocks. A likely massive collision with a Mars-sized object produced debris that eventually formed the Moon.</p>
