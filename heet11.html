<h1><i><u><b>Importance of Mental health</i></u></b></h1>
<p>Mental Health and Personal Well-Being<br>
Good mental health allows people to think clearly, manage emotions, and make sound decisions. It supports resilience in facing life’s challenges, reduces the likelihood of developing mental illnesses, and promotes emotional balance and happiness. Without good mental health, individuals may experience anxiety, depression, or other disorders that affect day-to-day functioning and quality of life.</p><br>
<p>Impact on Physical Health and Productivity
Mental health is closely linked to physical health because chronic stress or mental illness can lead to physical problems such as heart disease, weakened immune function, and fatigue. Moreover, good mental health boosts productivity, creativity, and engagement at work or school, whereas poor mental health can result in absenteeism, decreased performance, and economic cost at individual and societal levels.
